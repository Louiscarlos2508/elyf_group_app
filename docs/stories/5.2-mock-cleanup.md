# Story 5.2: Remove redundant MockRepositories

## Status
Pending

## Context
Many features were migrated to `OfflineRepositories` (Drift + Firebase), but the original `Mock` repositories used during early development are still present in the filesystem.

## Requirements
- Delete `lib/features/orange_money/data/repositories/mock_*.dart`.
- Identify and delete other `Mock` or `Fake` repositories in `boutique`, `immobilier`, etc.
- Ensure no code references these files.

## Verification
- App builds and runs correctly without these files.
- `flutter run` confirms all repository providers are using `Offline` implementations.
