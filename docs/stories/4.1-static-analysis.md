# Story 4.1: Static Analysis Priority Cleanup

## Status
Completed

## Context
The project had multiple lint warnings and unused imports across core services, particularly in the authentication and tenant modules, which cluttered the codebase and potentially hid bug signals.

## Changes
- Removed unused imports in `lib/core/auth/services/` and `lib/core/tenant/`.
- Resolved priority lint warnings in core services.
- Cleaned up deprecated Firebase and Drift usages as identified by static analysis.

## Verification
- `flutter analyze lib` confirmed cleanup of these specific modules.
