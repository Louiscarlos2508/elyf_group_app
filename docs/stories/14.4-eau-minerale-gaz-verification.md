# Story 14.4: Eau Minérale & Gaz Final Verification

## Context
Validating that the hardening process hasn't introduced regressions and that all requirements are met.

## Requirements
- Manual verification of soft-delete in the local database.
- Verification of multi-tenancy isolation (records from one enterprise shouldn't appear in another).
- Performance check for large lists with soft-delete filtering.
- Verification of synchronization for soft-deleted records.

## Implementation Details
Involves testing through the app UI and potentially checking the local SQLite database via `drift` tools or logs.
