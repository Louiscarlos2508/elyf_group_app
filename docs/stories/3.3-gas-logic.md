# Story 3.3: Gas Cylinder Stock Validation

This story implements cylinder stock validation in the `GasController` to prevent selling cylinders that are not available in inventory.

## User Review Required

> [!NOTE]
> We need to decide if we should block the sale entirely or just show a warning. The default behavior will be to block the sale unless the stock is sufficient.

## Proposed Changes

### Gas Feature

#### [MODIFY] [gas_controller.dart](file:///home/carlos-simpore/StudioProjects/elyf_group_app/lib/features/gaz/application/controllers/gas_controller.dart)
- Add stock validation in `addSale`.
- Integrate with `CylinderRepository` to check real-time stock levels.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Create `test/features/gaz/application/controllers/gas_controller_test.dart`.
- Verify that `addSale` fails if stock is insufficient.

### Manual Verification
- Attempt to sell 10 cylinders of a type that only has 5 in stock.
