# Story 5.1: Implement consistent audit logging

## Status
Pending

## Context
BMW Acceptance Criteria for Epic 3 required "consistent audit logs for all critical workflow transitions". Currently, `lib/features/audit_trail` is empty, and controllers perform actions without centralized audit trail recording.

## Requirements
- Create `AuditRecord` entity and `AuditTrailRepository`.
- Implement `AuditTrailService`.
- Integrate into `OrangeMoneyController.createTransaction`.
- Integrate into `GasController.createSale`.
- Integrate into `ProductionService.finalizeSession` (Eau Minerale).

## Verification
- Verify that a new collection `audit_trail` is populated in Firestore and local database after critical actions.
