# Story 12.1: Entity Alignment (Soft-delete & Audit)

## Context
Standardizing Boutique entities to support common patterns used in other stable modules.

## Requirements
- Update `Product`, `Sale`, `Purchase`, and `Expense` entities.
- Ensure all include `DateTime? deletedAt`, `String? deletedBy`, and `enterpriseId`.
- Add `isDeleted` getter to these entities.
- Update `fromMap` and `toMap` methods to handle new fields.

## Implementation Details
Check `lib/features/boutique/domain/entities/`.
