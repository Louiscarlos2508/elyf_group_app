## Context
Updating Boutique repositories to handle soft-deletion and improved sync reliability.

## Requirements
- Implement `watchDeleted*` methods in all Boutique repositories.
- Implement `restore*` methods.
- Update `delete*` methods to perform soft-deletes (logic currently in controllers or missing).
- Refactor `SaleOfflineRepository` for better error handling and logging.

## Implementation Details
Check `lib/features/boutique/data/repositories/`.
