# Story 14.2: Eau Minérale & Gaz Repository Hardening

## Context
Transitioning physical deletes to soft-deletes and enforcing multi-tenancy at the data access layer for `Eau Minérale` and `Gaz`.

## Requirements
- Update `deleteFromLocal` to perform soft-deletes.
- Filter out soft-deleted records in all `fetch` and `watch` methods.
- Enforce `enterpriseId` in all queries to local storage (`driftService`).
- Standardize the use of `fromMap` and `toMap` for persistence.

## Implementation Details
Check `lib/features/eau_minerale/data/repositories/` and `lib/features/gaz/data/repositories/`.
Ensures that all operational data (sales, production, expenses) is correctly isolated by enterprise.
