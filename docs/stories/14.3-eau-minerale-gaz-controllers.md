# Story 14.3: Eau Minérale & Gaz Controller & Service Refinement

## Context
Updating the higher-level application logic to support the hardened repositories and provide necessary metadata (like `deletedBy`).

## Requirements
- Update Services to pass the current user's ID to delete operations for `deletedBy` tracking.
- Ensure Controllers handle the absence of soft-deleted records correctly.
- Verify that synchronization logic correctly handles soft-deleted flags when pushing/pulling from remote.

## Implementation Details
Focus on `lib/features/eau_minerale/application/` and `lib/features/gaz/application/`.
Also check related Riverpod providers in `lib/features/eau_minerale/presentation/providers/`.
