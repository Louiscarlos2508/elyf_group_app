# Epic 9: Dashboard & Feature Completion

## Goal
Implement module-specific dashboards and finalize high-priority features for `Eau Minérale` and `Gaz`.

## Context
While core business logic is stable, the user experience requires a centralized dashboard for each module to provide real-time metrics (sales, stock, production). This epic focus on UI/UX completion.
